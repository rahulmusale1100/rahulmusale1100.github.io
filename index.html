      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>"I am a highly motivated and results-driven individual with a strong background and interest in Astronomy and Astrophysics, particularly in the field of radio astronomy. I have a deep understanding of the principles and techniques involved in the study of radio emissions from celestial bodies, and have gained knowledge on working with radio telescopes and data analysis through my coursework and self-study. My passion for this field has led me to participate in various research projects and gain theoretical knowledge on the field. I am eager to continue to build my knowledge and skills in this field and make significant contributions to the advancement of radio astronomy."</p>

      <h2>Research Projects & Experience</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Extragalactic Compact Radio Sources - Description: Our work mainly focuses on Investigating asymmetries in Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) and Peaked Spectrum (PS) Sources.
The majority of these sources are likely to be young sources, advancing outwards through a dense inhomogeneous environment.
By evaluating symmetry parameters and using HI column densities, We are investigating whether orientation-based projection effects or intrinsic asymmetries dominate the asymmetric nature of these sources.</li>
        <li>Magnetic Inclination Angle of the Pulsar - Description: We are investigating whether the magnetic inclination angle of the Pulsar affect the properties of Pulsar emission and by looking at its magnetic inclination angle and pulse profile shape, we intend to find whether there is any relation between them.</li>
        <li>Radio Image Analysis Using CASA - Description: In this project, I have gone through different aspects of radio image synthesis like cross correlators, calibrations (flux, phase, bandpass, etc), deconvolution, and error recognition. During this project, I worked on  the raw radio interferometer data from the Very Large Array (VLA) and Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) for image synthesis using CASA. For VLA data, I made HI radio images of the Spiral galaxy NGC 5921 and 3C 75 in the cluster of the galaxies Abell 400 at 1.4 GHz Frequency.</li>

    <section id="other experience">
      <h2>Other Experience</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I have one year of work experience at an internet cafe that I acquired in 2017. During my time there, I gained a range of skills, such as customer service, problem solving, and computer literacy. I was responsible for helping customers with their computer and internet needs, troubleshooting any technical issues, and providing general assistance. Additionally, I learned how to properly use computers and software, as well as how to maintain a neat and organized work space.</li>
